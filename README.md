# Open Spending Austria - Offenerhaushalt.at

This repository was created for the project data.offenerhaushalt.at. It was sponsored by netidee.at and hat two main goals
1. creation of a data interface to the municipal spending data available at www.offenerhaushalt.at - the interface is available at https://data.offenerhaushalt.at in German and English
2. implementation of an metadata standard, so that data published on Offenerhaushalt.at can be harvested and indexed by other data portals, e. g. data.gv.at and europeandataportal.eu

Under "Terminology" we published a vocabulary for public spending in Austria in (German, Englisch)
Under "scr" the source code can be found created during the project. Please note that this is NOT a repository for the whole project www.offenerhaushalt.at but only for the above mentioned parts.
